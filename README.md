# wi-fellowship-model

This repo contains data and scripts for building the vignettes and inset figures for Voter et al. (in Review). 

**NOTE:** Vignette builds require the 24k flowlines layer from the WI DNR, which can be downloaded at [https://www.arcgis.com/home/user.html?user=Wi_DNR_Data](this website).
